## How to run the game

To run the game, you need to have a C++ compiler and an IDE that supports C++. You can download and install [Visual Studio Code], which is a free and popular IDE for C++ development. You also need to install the [C/C++ extension] for Visual Studio Code, which provides features such as IntelliSense, debugging, and code formatting.

To compile and run the game, follow these steps:

1.  Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2.  Open the folder containing the game files in Visual Studio Code.
3.  Open the main.cpp file, which contains the source code of the game.
4.  Press Ctrl+Shift+B to run the build task, which will compile the code and generate an executable file.
5.  Press Ctrl+F5 to run the game without debugging, or F5 to run the game with debugging.
6.  Enjoy the game and have fun!

## How to play the game

The game is very simple and intuitive to play. You will see a menu with three options: Play, Rules, and Exit. You can use the arrow keys and the Enter key to navigate the menu and select an option.

-   If you choose Play, you will start a new game against the computer. You will see three choices: Rock, Paper, or Scissors. You can use the arrow keys and the Enter key to select your choice. The computer will also select a choice randomly. The game will compare your choice and the computer’s choice and determine the winner according to the standard rules: Rock beats Scissors, Scissors beats Paper, and Paper beats Rock. The game will display the choices and the result using ASCII art. The game will also update the score and show it on the screen. You can play as many rounds as you want, until you press the Esc key to go back to the menu.
